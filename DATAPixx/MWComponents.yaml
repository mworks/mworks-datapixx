description: >
    Interface to a `DATAPixx <https://vpixx.com/our-products/video-i-o-hub/>`_
    or `VIEWPixx <https://vpixx.com/our-products/crt-replacement/>`_ device
parameters: 
  - 
    name: update_interval
    required: yes
    example: 3ms
    description: >
        MWorks will poll the device for new input data every ``update_interval``
        microseconds
  - 
    name: clock_offset_nanos
    description: |
        Variable in which to store the computed offset (in nanoseconds) between
        the device clock and MWorks' clock.

        The clock offset is recomputed once per second and is used to convert
        DATAPixx event and sample times to MWorks times.  Use this parameter if
        you want a record of the computed clock offsets in your event file.
  - 
    name: enable_dout_pixel_mode
    default: 'NO'
    description: |
        If ``YES``, the digital output port will be used to output the RGB value
        of the first upper left pixel of the screen.

        In this mode, the digital output port cannot be used for `bit output
        <DATAPixx Bit Output Channel>` or `word output <DATAPixx Word Output
        Channel>` channels.  However, these channels may still be configured on
        the digital input port.
  - 
    name: enable_dout_vsync_mode
    default: 'NO'
    description: |
        If ``YES``, the VSYNC signal will be output on bit 23 of the digital
        output port.

        This mode cannot be enabled if `enable_dout_pixel_mode`_ is set to
        ``YES``.
  - 
    name: enable_din_stabilize
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, digital input transitions are recognized only after the
        entire digital input bus has been stable for 80 nanoseconds
  - 
    name: enable_din_debounce
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, after a digital input transitions, further transitions will
        be ignored for the next 30 milliseconds
  - 
    name: enable_dout_din_loopback
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, digital output bits are looped back to the corresponding
        digital input bits.  This is useful primarily for testing the device.
  - 
    name: din_event_buffer_size
    default: 100
    description: >
        Transitions on digital input bits 0-15 are logged to an on-device buffer
        and read by MWorks at the rate specified by `update_interval`_. This
        parameter sets the maximum size (in number of events) of the buffer.  If
        the buffer is too small, writes will "wrap", and new events will
        overwrite old ones.
  - 
    name: analog_input_data_interval
    example: 1ms
    description: >
        Interval between acquired samples on analog input channels
        (microseconds)
  - 
    name: enable_dac_adc_loopback
    default: 'NO'
    description: |
        If ``YES``, analog outputs are looped back to analog inputs as follows::

            DAC_DATA0 → ADC_DATA0/2/4/6/8/10/12/14
            DAC_DATA1 → ADC_DATA1/3/5/7/9/11/13/15
            DAC_DATA2 → ADC_REF0
            DAC_DATA3 → ADC_REF1

        This is useful primarily for testing the device.
